        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
          Maffucci syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by
          benign overgrowths of cartilage (enchondromas), skeletal deformities
          and cutaneous lesions composed of abnormal blood vessels. Enchondromas
          arise in bones, most frequently in the hands and feet, and less often
          in the legs and long bones of the arm. It is named for the Italian
          pathologist Angelo Maria Maffucci who described it in 1881. Fewer than
          1000 cases of this syndrome have been reported worldwide.
        </p>
        <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
          Maffucci syndrome is not recognizable at birth. Lesions usually
          develop early in childhood, most often between 1-5 years of age. The
          severity of the disorder is variable. Some patients have a very benign
          course, whereas others develop serious complications. The symptoms
          that occur as a result of Maffucci syndrome can be separated into
          three components:
          <b
            >skeletal abnormalities, skin abnormalities, and lymphatic
            abnormalities</b
          >.
        </p>
        <p><b>Skeletal Abnormalities</b></p>
        <p>
          The skeletal abnormalities that are found are the result of the
          formation of multiple enchondromas throughout the skeleton. An
          enchondroma occurs when cartilage cells grow within or alongside the
          bone. These bony abnormalities can cause deformities, limb shortening,
          and projections from the bone. They occur most commonly within the
          limbs, especially the hands and the feet. However, enchondromas can
          also occur in the skull, ribs, and vertebrae. Most people with
          Maffucci syndrome will have at least one of their enchondromas become
          cancerous in their lifetime. As a result of the skeletal
          abnormalities, it is not uncommon for people with Maffucci syndrome to
          have a short stature, and often there is a degree of muscle weakening.
          The muscle weakening can be subtle, and may not be noticeable.
        </p>
        <p><b>Skin Abnormalities</b></p>
        <p>
          Maffucci syndrome is distinguished from Ollier disease, also a
          condition causing multiple enchondromas, by the presence of
          hemangiomas. A hemangioma is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that
          occurs within the skin causing reddish or purplish growths. These
          hemangiomas can occur throughout the skin of the body. The hemangioma
          is often the first sign of Maffucci syndrome that is detected, seen
          before any of the enchondromas are detected.
        </p>
        <p><b>Lymphatic Abnormalities</b></p>
        <p>
          Lastly, lymphatic abnormalities can occur throughout the body. Similar
          to the hemangiomas, these tangles of lymphatic vessels are called
          lymphangiomas. A lymphangioma can lead to the abnormal circulation of
          lymphatic fluid leading to swelling within the extremities. People who
          have lymphatic blockages can have edema of the extremities, where
          fluid causes swelling most often noticed in the feet and ankles.
        </p>
        <p><b>Pain</b></p>
        <p>
          Maffucci syndrome can cause significant pain or discomfort,The most
          common reasons for the pain to occur are because the enchondroma is
          either causing pressure against a surrounding tendon, nerve, or other
          soft tissue structure, or the enchondroma has caused a weakening of
          the bone leading to susceptibility of fracture. If the bone is weak
          and significantly, even low energy injuries can result in a problem
          called a pathologic fracture. Pain can also be a sign of the
          development of transformation of the benign enchondroma to potentially
          cancerous chondrosarcoma.
        </p>
        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>
          The cause of Maffucci syndrome was discovered to be a change
          (mutation) in a gene known as IDH1 (rarely IDH2). The same mutations
          are found in the related disorder Ollier disease. Since the defect
          occurs after fertilization (called a somatic mutation), Maffucci
          syndrome is not considered to be hereditary, that is, it cannot be
          passed along in a family. The cases occur randomly and there are no
          known pedigrees of affected family members.
        </p>
        <h4>Related Disorders</h4>
        <p>
          The following disorders can look similar to Maffucci syndrome;
          however, they usually can be differentiated by clinical examination.
        </p>
        <p><b>Ollier Disease</b></p>
        <p>
          This is a rare skeletal disorder characterized by abnormal bony
          development and enchondromas, in the absence of cutaneous vascular
          lesions that characterize Maffucci syndrome. While Ollier disease is
          present at birth, it may not become apparent until early childhood
          when skeletal deformities or abnormal growth of a limb occurs. Ollier
          disease primarily affects the long bones and cartilage of the joints
          of the arms and legs, specifically where the shaft and head of the
          long bone meet (metaphysis). The pelvis is also often involved and
          more rarely, the ribs, breast bone (sternum) and cranium are affected.
          There disease involves growth of enchondromas from cartilage in the
          long bones so that the outer layer (cortical bone) becomes thin and
          fragile. After puberty, these cartilaginous growths stabilize as
          cartilage is replaced by bone. These enchondromas may undergo
          malignant degeneration but far less frequently than in Maffucci
          syndrome.In many patients, somatic mutations are found in the
          isocitrate dehydrogenase gene, IDH1 or IDH2. The disorder is not
          inherited.
        </p>
        <p><b>Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome</b></p>
        <p>
          The blue vascular lesions of Maffucci syndrome can be mistaken for
          this rare vascular disorder that is characterized by multiple, soft,
          elevated, blue, blue-black or purplish-red swellings (venous
          malformations). The lesions arise in the skin and internal organs,
          particularly the gastrointestinal tract. They typically appear on the
          hands and soles of the feet, but can also arise anywhere on the body,
          including the face and trunk, and in the liver, lungs, spleen,
          gallbladder, kidney and skeletal muscles. These internal lesions can
          cause serious complications. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract
          usually results in chronic anemia that may require blood transfusion.
          The cause is known to be a somatic mutation in the gene TIE 2 (TEK)
          (For more information on this disorder, choose “Blue Rubber Bleb
          Nevus” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database).
        </p>
        <p><b>Proteus Syndrome</b></p>
        <p>
          This extremely rare condition may be confused with Maffucci syndrome.
          It is characterized by cerebriform connective tissue nevi (“moccasin
          feet”), epidermal nevi, lipomas and disproportionate, relentless, and
          asymmetrical skeletal overgrowth. Patients with Proteus are
          essentially normal at birth, except for the nevi. They also can have
          capillary malformations and venous malformations. The enlarged veins
          put them at risk for pulmonary thromboembolism, which can be fatal.
          The cause is a somatic activating mutation in the gene AKT1 occurring
          in cells during the early embryonic period. It is not hereditary. (For
          more information on this disorder, choose “Proteus” as your search
          term in the Rare Disease Database). A subset of patients initially
          diagnosed as having Proteus syndrome have another overgrowth disorder
          CLOVES caused by mutations in the gene PIK3CA. (For more information
          on this disorder, choose “CLOVES” as your search term in the Rare
          Disease Database).
        </p>
        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
        <p>
          The diagnosis of Maffucci syndrome is made by a detailed history,
          thorough physical examination and radiologic assessment. Surgical
          removal and microscopic study of the skeletal lesions confirm the
          presence of enchondroma and distinguish the tumor from chondrosarcoma.
        </p>
        <h6>Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          There is no way to prevent Maffucci syndrome. Treatment of the
          disorder is focused on addressing symptoms related to the multiple
          enchondromas. Often enchondromas in this situation require treatment
          because they can interfere with skeletal and joint function. In
          addition, if an enchondroma becomes large enough, it can weaken the
          bone leading to the susceptibility of pathologic fractures. If there
          is a concern that the bone is being significantly weekend, your
          healthcare provider may recommend removal of the bone growth and
          stabilization of the bone.
